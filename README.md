## Hi, I’m [@PrimeMonket](https://github.com/PrimeMonket).
-	👀 I’m a computer science student, passionate about Virtual Machines, Cybersecurity, and Frontend Development and always looking to improve my skills in these areas.
-	💞️ I am currently looking to collaborate on my recent project, [Always A Virtual Machine](https://github.com/PrimeMonket/Always-A-Virtual-machine/). It’s an exciting program, and I would love to have contributions from others.
-	📫 You can reach me on Discord at 'monket_thegreat'. I’m always open to collaborating, discussing new ideas, and seeking advice.

-	⚡ Fun fact: I’m a computer science student with no knowledge of C++, so any help is appreciated!
-	🌱 Besides my core interests, I enjoy diving into open-source projects and adding to the community.
-	🎯 Outside of coding, I love engaging in technology, and staying updated with the latest trends of Cybersecurity.

### ToDo List
- Commit more updates to [Always A Virtual Machine](https://github.com/PrimeMonket/Always-A-Virtual-machine/).
- Learn C++.
    - Rewrite [Always A Virtual Machine](https://github.com/PrimeMonket/Always-A-Virtual-machine/) in C++.
